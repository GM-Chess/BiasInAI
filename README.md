# BiasInAI
About the code: it is a linear regresion model trained then tested three diffrent times with three unique data sets. The goal was to predict canadas GDP using
Canada's National Banks Total Assets and Total Book Debit. 
The first data set is a random 80% mask and the remainding 20% was used to test the model. 
The second data set is training the model with only good fiscal years and testing with bad years. 
Finaly, the third data set was a random small sample size of 15% and the remaining 85% was to test.  
The code for this report originaly was for an exercise to get a better understanding in machine learning while improving my Python skills. It was suggested to me by my research professor. Then after making a code a few months later I had to write a report for a project. This project was for my engineering communications class. I chose bias in AI. After, some research I gathered that one reason causeing bias in AI is that the data set choosen to train the ML algorithm will effect the preformance of the model. First I trained the algortithm with 80% random masked data and tested with the remaining 20%. Next, I choose really good fiscal years
